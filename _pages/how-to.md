> This post is to help you get started.

## How to write a post

* You need to create a new file in the `_posts` directory
* The file has to have the dat in the title, using the ISO standard: `YEAR-MM-DD`
* After the date, use a `-` and then the title (no spaces only dashes)
* THe file should end in `.md` becasue its a [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) file

```

```

### markdown help

YOu can make it **bold** with two `**bold**` and you can do _italics_ like `_italics_`.

### how to add pictures

I don't know how to do that yet.  There are example page layouts and post layouts in the [docs folder](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/master/docs) of the theme website.


## Running the website locally

You can test out your website changes before you save them to the internet.

* Open the `Terminal` application
* Then inside the terminal change into the project directoy: `cd Coding/nuria-jekyll` (TIP: _you an hit tab to autocomplet the location)
* Then you can start the server: `bundle exect jekyll serve`
* After it's running, you can see your web page at: http://127.0.0.1:4000

## Saving changes to the internet

* When you are done make sure you save all your work
* Then go to the "Source Control" area and use the `+` sign to _stage_ your changes
* Once you _staged_ all your changes (you can do all or some) then you need to _commit_ those changes (that means really save them all on your computer)
* After you have _committed_ them then you can _push_ them into the internet
