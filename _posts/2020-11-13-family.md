> If you have not have much time with your family, this is for you.
Things you can do with your family is that you can watch a movie with them. You can play a family game that you will all enjoy. Also you can take turns telling a dream that happened to you or acually happend in real life. If someone is bothering you, you can say," i don't appeciate that." then you can walk away and think of something else.
