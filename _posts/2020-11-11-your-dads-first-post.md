Hi Nuria!  

This is your dad writing your first post.

I am sure you are **not** happy about that at all!  As as soon as you learn a bit more you can write your own posts.

You are going to have a _lot_ to learn to become a scientist and a computer programmer but I know you can do it.  This is just the start.

Love,
Damon
