In my life i’ve had struggles, i am sure you had at least one. I will give you some struggles i’ve had, also what i did to solve it. This can help you also if you happend to have the same problem. One day I wanted to have soft and beutiful face, so i looked for a face mask cream. When i found it i put it on. When I saw the results I was in shock when i saw my face, it was red! What I did was that I washed my face then waited for the next day to make it better and heal up
